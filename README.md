# RUN_Hackathon
This repository was used in the RUN Hackathon.

The goal of our project is to create NFTs of Kryptonians avatars. Each Kryptonian has Power, Shield and Speed attributes.

Depending on the Hackathon result, our wish is to create a game where people can use their Kryptonias to fight in a battle field. Thee winner will be granted the Krytonians tokens (ERC20).

To run this project, you will need **npm** installed. Then you need to run the following commands:

1) npm i
2) npm run build
3) npm start

Then, go to your browser and type http://localhost:8888/ 
You will need a Money Button Account :https://www.moneybutton.com/)
